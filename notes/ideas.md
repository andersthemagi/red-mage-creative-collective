# Red Mage Creative Collective Ideas

## Stakeholders
- Collective Members
  - Core part of the collective, on the LLC as a partner
- Creatives, Not-Members
  - Could be artists selling through us
  - Could be aspiring artists renting space or something
  - Could be artists that receive funding from us
- Supporters, Not-Members
  - Members of the community that want to purchase product or donate to the causes

## Selling Channels
- Would need someone to set up shopify, etsy, etc. with company bank account
- Online selling through Shopify, Etsy, and Instagram (Shopify Integration)
- Phsyical selling through marts and eventually a physical store

## Marketing Channels
- Would likely need help from someone Digital Marketing inclined
- TikTok
- Instagram (would 
- Pinterest
- Email (for customers)
- Discord (for Artists)

## Opportunity for Artists
- Grants for artists
- 

## Ideas for keeping the collective alive
- Membership / Fellowship fees
  - Up-front membership fees
    - would cover Shopify, storefront rent, marketing costs, etc. as well as give core members
  - Minimal deductions from product sold (sales tax, etc.)
  - May be hard for artists to keep up with fees
- Percentage fees from sales
  - No upfront costs
  - Dependent on the shop doing well
  - Percentage should be viable without being restrictive to the artist
